    Compute the Ewald sphere z-offset Δz(|k|) for a given acceleration voltage.

    The basic relation used here is

        Δz(|k|) = λ / (2 d^2)  with  d = 1 / |k|

    i.e.

        Δz(|k|) = (λ |k|^2) / 2

    where
        - λ is the wavelength (computed from voltage),
        - |k| is the spatial frequency magnitude in inverse length units.

    Parameters
    ----------
    voltage_kv:
        Acceleration voltage in kV. Wavelength is computed from this using
        relativistic electron wavelength formula. Converted to energy in eV
        (energy = voltage_kv * 1e3) for the calculation.
    k_xy:
        In-plane spatial frequency magnitude |k_xy| (e.g. 1 / Å). This is
        typically constructed from a 2D Fourier grid as

            |k_xy| = sqrt(k_x^2 + k_y^2)

    flip_sign:
        If True, return -Δz so that the curvature can be applied in the
        opposite direction.
    eps:
        Small clamp value to avoid division by zero at |k| ≈ 0.

    Returns
    -------
    delta_z:
        Δz(|k|) with the same shape as `k_xy`.

    Modify the z-coordinate of a central slice frequency grid to follow a curve.

    Parameters
    ----------
    freq_grid:
        `(h, w, 3)` tensor of zyx frequencies (cycles / pixel), as returned by
        `_central_slice_fftfreq_grid`.
    voltage_kv:
        Acceleration voltage in kV. Wavelength is computed from this using
        relativistic electron wavelength formula.
    flip_sign:
        If True, apply the curvature with opposite sign.
    px_size:
        Pixel size (e.g. Å / pixel). Used to convert grid frequencies
        (cycles / pixel) to physical units.
    eps:
        Clamp value to avoid division by zero in the Ewald formula.
